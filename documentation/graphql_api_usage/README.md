The queries listed here can be tested by copy-pasting into the Postgraphile graphiql page,
and also used as is in the frontend's Apollo client. Most of the API is intended to be consumed by the
web frontend. For computational scientists using a programmatic client, specific GraphQL queries
are defined in `9-programmatic-api.sql`.
